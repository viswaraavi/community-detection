Market Segmentation using Attributed Graph Community Detection
Overview: Market segmentation divides a broad target market into subsets of consumers or
businesses that have or are perceived to have common needs, interests, and priorities. These
segments help firms or businesses focus on their target groups effectively and allocate resources
efficiently. Traditional segmentation methods are solely based on attribute data such as
demographics (age, sex, ethnicity, education, etc.) and psychographic profiles (lifestyle,
personality, motives, etc.). However, social networks have recently become important for
marketing. Depending on the nature of the market, social relations can even become vital in
forming segments. Such social relations combined with demographic properties can be used to
find more relevant subsets of consumers or businesses (i.e., communities).
In this project, we aim to find such market segments given social network data. These social
relations can be captured in a graph framework where nodes represent customers/users and
edges represent some social relationship. The properties belonging to each customer/user can
be treated as node attributes. Hence, market segmentation becomes the problem of community
detection over attributed graphs, where the communities are formed based on graph structure as
well as attribute similarities.


Influence Propagation: It has been discovered that by targeting the influential users/groups,
desirable marketing goals can be achieved. Therefore, one way to evaluate the quality of the
market segments (communities) is to influence an entity in each segment and measure how fast
the influence propagates over the entire network. The faster that influence propagates through
the entire network, the more likely an advertising campaign, for example, will be successful.

Goal: To implement a community detection algorithm for attributed graphs, find the relevant
market segments, and evaluate the obtained segments via influence propagation.
